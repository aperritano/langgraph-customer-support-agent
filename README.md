# Building an Intelligent Customer Support Agent: A Journey Through the LangChain Ecosystem

## Introduction

Imagine a customer service agent that never sleeps, responds instantly to inquiries about orders and refunds, knows when to escalate complex issues to humans, and continuously improves through rigorous evaluation. This project brings that vision to life as a demonstration of the LangChain ecosystem's capabilities for building production-ready AI agents.

At its heart, this is a story about learning by doing—exploring the vast landscape of agent architectures, tooling, and evaluation frameworks while keeping one principle paramount: **simplicity first**.

## Design Philosophy: Keep It Simple

Rather than building a sprawling multi-agent system from the outset, this project embraces an intentionally straightforward architecture. The customer support agent serves as a focused exploration of core concepts: tool usage, knowledge retrieval, human-in-the-loop patterns, and comprehensive testing. By mastering these fundamentals, we create a solid foundation for future complexity.

### The Agent's Journey

When a customer reaches out with a question, the agent springs into action. It searches through a vector database containing company policies and retrieves relevant customer data from mock databases. Armed with this context, it responds to inquiries about orders, refunds, and account issues. But here's the crucial part: the agent knows its limits. When an issue requires human judgment or escalation, it gracefully interrupts the workflow to create a support ticket, ensuring customers get the care they need.

![Agent Workflow Graph](images/langgraph-graph-mermaid.png)

*The agent's workflow: a clean cycle between reasoning, tool usage, and knowing when to stop or escalate.*

### Architecture in Action

The system architecture reflects real-world production considerations:

- **Knowledge Layer**: Vector database for policy documents and mock customer data stores
- **Intelligence Layer**: Powered by Ollama's `llama3.1:latest` model for local, cost-effective inference
- **Interface Layer**: LangChain Studio and Agent UI provide a streaming chat experience
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive TDD tests ensure reliability
- **Deployment**: Docker configuration for consistent environments across development and production

![Agent Chat Interface](images/agent-ui-start.png)

*The Agent Chat UI: a simple, clean interface for interacting with the customer support agent via localhost deployment.*

### Rigorous Evaluation Framework

Quality isn't accidental—it's measured. The evaluation system puts the agent through its paces with 10 diverse customer scenarios, scoring responses across five dimensions:

1. **Tool Usage**: Does the agent call the right functions?
2. **Keyword Presence**: Are critical terms and information included?
3. **Response Quality**: Is the answer accurate and complete?
4. **Empathy**: Does the agent acknowledge customer concerns?
5. **Actionability**: Can the customer act on the guidance provided?

Every evaluation run uploads detailed results to the [LangSmith dashboard](https://smith.langchain.com), complete with conversation traces, per-test feedback explaining pass/fail decisions, and aggregate scores. This creates a feedback loop for continuous improvement and regression detection.

![LangSmith Test Examples](images/eval-summary-examples.png)

*The evaluation dataset: 10 diverse customer scenarios testing everything from frustrated complaints to simple inventory questions.*

![LangSmith Evaluation Metrics](images/eval-summary-experiments.png)

*Performance metrics across all evaluation dimensions, with aggregate scores showing how the agent performs on tool usage, response quality, empathy, and more.*

**Running Evaluations**: Execute `python -m src.support_agent.tests.eval_langsmith` and view comprehensive metrics in LangSmith's web interface to track performance trends over time.

## The Road Ahead

This foundation opens doors to exciting possibilities:

**Multi-Agent Workflows**: Evolve from a single agent to a supervised ensemble where specialized agents handle distinct business processes—one for refunds, another for order modifications, each an expert in its domain. A primary assistant would orchestrate these specialists, routing requests to the right team member.

**Enhanced Human Collaboration**: Implement more sophisticated interrupt patterns for confirmations and executions, creating seamless handoffs between AI and human agents.

**Enterprise Data Integration**: Replace mock data with SQL-based customer databases, connecting the agent to real business systems and workflows.

The journey from simple to sophisticated is just beginning—but the foundation is rock solid.

    """Description of what this checks."""
    response = run.outputs.get("answer", "")

    # Your logic here
    if some_condition:
        return {
            "key": "my_metric",
            "score": 1.0,
            "comment": "Why it passed"
        }
    else:
        return {
            "key": "my_metric",
            "score": 0.0,
            "comment": "Why it failed"
        }
```

See `src/support_agent/tests/custom_evaluators.py` for implementation examples and detailed comments.

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding a New Tool

Tools are how the agent interacts with external systems. Here's how to add one:

#### 1. Define the Tool

Edit `src/support_agent/tools.py`:

```python
@tool
def your_new_tool(param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> str:
    """Short description of what the tool does.
    
    Use this tool when:
    - Situation 1
    - Situation 2
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter
        param2: Optional parameter with default
    
    Returns:
        Description of what the tool returns
    """
    # Your implementation here
    result = do_something(param1, param2)
    return f"Result: {result}"
```

#### 2. Add to Tools List

At the bottom of `tools.py`:

```python
tools = [
    search_knowledge_base,
    get_order_status,
    # ... existing tools
    your_new_tool,  # Add here
]
```

#### 3. Test It

```python
python scripts/test_bot.py
```

That's it! The agent will automatically learn to use your tool.

### Modifying the System Prompt

The system prompt guides the agent's behavior.

Edit `src/support_agent/prompts.py`:

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful customer support agent...

Your job is to:
1. [Add your custom instructions]
2. [More instructions]
...
"""
```

### Changing the LLM Model

Edit `src/support_agent/agent.py`:

```python
llm = ChatOllama(
    model="llama3.1:latest",  # Change this
    temperature=0.3,      # Adjust creativity (0-1)
)
```

Available Ollama models:

- `llama3.1:latest` - Fast, efficient (recommended)
- `mistral:7b` - Good balance
- `qwen2.5:7b` - Strong reasoning
- `llama3.1:8b` - Larger, more capable

### Adding RAG (Vector Search)

The project already includes vector search implementation! To customize:

#### 1. Modify Vector Store

Edit `src/support_agent/vector_store.py`:

```python
# Use different embedding model
def __init__(self, embeddings_model: str = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"):
```

Popular alternatives:

- `all-mpnet-base-v2` - Higher quality, slower
- `all-MiniLM-L12-v2` - Balance between speed and quality

#### 2. Test Vector Search

```bash
python scripts/init_vector_store.py
```

### Integrating Real Systems

#### Connect to Order Management System

```python
@tool
def get_order_status(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Look up real order status."""
    import requests
    
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://your-api.com/orders/{order_id}",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
    )
    
    order = response.json()
    return format_order_status(order)
```

#### Connect to CRM

```python
@tool
def get_customer_info(email: str) -> str:
    """Get customer details from CRM."""
    # Connect to Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.
    customer = crm_client.get_customer(email)
    return format_customer_info(customer)
```

### Adding Conversation Memory

LangGraph already includes checkpointing, but you can extend it:

```python
# In agent.py
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver

# Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
memory = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(
    "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname"
)
```

## 🐳 Docker Setup (Recommended for Quick Start)

The easiest way to get started! Everything is pre-configured and ready to run.

### Quick Start with Docker

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker and Docker Compose installed ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- That's it! No need to install Python, Ollama, or any dependencies manually

**Start Everything:**

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone <repository-url>
cd langgraph-customer-support-agent

# Start all services (first run will take 5-10 minutes to download models)
docker-compose up
```

**What happens automatically:**

1. ✅ Ollama service starts
2. ✅ Downloads llama3.1:latest model (happens once, ~2GB)
3. ✅ Support bot starts and connects to Ollama
4. ✅ API ready at <http://localhost:8123>

**Access the application:**

- Agent UI Interface: <http://localhost:8123>
- Ollama API: <http://localhost:11434>

### Using Agent UI with Docker

Once Docker is running, access the Agent UI interface:

1. **Start the Docker containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   Wait for the message: "Ollama initialization complete!"

2. **Access the Agent UI** in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:8123
   ```

3. **Start chatting**:

   ![Agent UI Start](images/agent-ui-start.png)

   Click "Start Agent" and begin interacting with your customer support bot

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start in background (detached mode)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f support-bot
docker-compose logs -f ollama
docker-compose logs ollama-init

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all data (including downloaded models)
docker-compose down -v

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose up --build

# Use a different model
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:latest docker-compose up
```

### Docker Architecture

The setup includes three services:

1. **ollama** - Ollama service for running LLMs
   - Automatically starts and stays healthy
   - Models stored in persistent volume
   - Accessible at <http://ollama:11434> (internal) and <http://localhost:11434> (external)

2. **ollama-init** - One-time model initialization
   - Automatically pulls llama3.1:latest model on first run
   - Ensures model is ready before starting the bot
   - Exits after successful initialization

3. **support-bot** - The LangGraph customer support agent
   - Starts only after Ollama and model are ready
   - Hot-reload enabled for development (code changes auto-reload)
   - Exposes API on port 8123

### Benefits of Docker Setup

✅ **Zero Configuration** - Everything just works out of the box
✅ **Consistent Environment** - Same setup on any OS (Mac, Linux, Windows)
✅ **Isolated** - Won't conflict with your system Python/Ollama installations
✅ **Easy Cleanup** - Remove everything with one command
✅ **Production Ready** - Same setup works for dev and production
✅ **Hot Reload** - Code changes automatically reload in the container

The Docker setup automatically configures:

- LangGraph server on port 8123
- Ollama service with llama3.1:latest model pre-loaded
- Persistent storage for conversation history
- Network connectivity between all services
- Volume mounts for live code editing

### Customizing the Docker Setup

**Change the model:**

Edit [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml):

```yaml
ollama-init:
  environment:
    - OLLAMA_HOST=http://ollama:11434
    - OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:latest  # Change this line
```

Available models:

- `llama3.1:latest` - Recommended, fast, efficient (~1GB RAM)
- `mistral:7b` - More capable (~5GB RAM)
- `qwen2.5:7b` - Strong reasoning (~5GB RAM)
- `llama3.1:8b` - Larger, most capable (~7GB RAM)

**Development mode with hot reload:**

The docker-compose.yml already mounts source directories:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./src:/app/src        # Code changes reload automatically
  - ./data:/app/data      # Knowledge base changes
  - ./storage:/app/storage # Persistent conversation history
```

Just edit your code locally and it will reload automatically in the container!

### Troubleshooting Docker

**Issue: Slow first startup**

- This is normal! First run downloads the Ollama model (~2GB)
- Subsequent starts are much faster (5-10 seconds)
- Check progress: `docker-compose logs -f ollama-init`

**Issue: Port already in use**

```bash
# Change ports in docker-compose.yml
services:
  support-bot:
    ports:
      - "8124:8123"  # Use port 8124 instead of 8123
```

**Issue: Out of memory**

- Ollama models need 4-8GB RAM available
- Free up memory or use a smaller model (llama3.1:latest)
- Check Docker Desktop settings to allocate more RAM

**Issue: Model download fails**

```bash
# Check internet connection and logs
docker-compose logs ollama-init

# Manually pull model
docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.1:latest

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

**Issue: Container won't start**

```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View detailed logs
docker-compose logs

# Clean restart
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

**Issue: Changes not reflecting**

```bash
# For Dockerfile changes, force rebuild:
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build

# For Python code changes, just restart the service:
docker-compose restart support-bot

# Note: Volume-mounted files (src/, data/) should auto-reload
```

**Issue: Can't connect to Ollama**

```bash
# Check if Ollama service is healthy
docker-compose ps

# Test Ollama directly
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Check network connectivity between containers
docker-compose exec support-bot curl http://ollama:11434/api/tags
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

#### Python Version Error

**Error**: `requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13"`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check your Python version
python --version

# Must be Python 3.11 or 3.12 (3.12 recommended)
# If version is < 3.11 or >= 3.13, install Python 3.12
# macOS:
brew install python@3.12

# Linux:
sudo apt install python3.12

# Windows: Download Python 3.12 from python.org
```

#### ModuleNotFoundError

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph'`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Import Error from 'src'

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
pwd  # Should show: .../langgraph-customer-support-agent

# Install package in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Or run scripts with full path
python -m scripts.cli
```

### Ollama Issues

#### Ollama Not Running

**Error**: `Connection refused` or `Failed to connect to Ollama`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# If not running, start it
ollama serve

# On macOS, you can also:
brew services start ollama
```

#### Model Not Found

**Error**: `Model 'llama3.1:latest' not found`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Pull the model
ollama pull llama3.1:latest

# Verify it's installed
ollama list

# If you want a different model
ollama pull llama3.1:latest
# Then update src/support_agent/agent.py
```

#### Ollama Running but Not Responding

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check Ollama logs
tail -f ~/.ollama/logs/server.log

# Restart Ollama
pkill ollama
ollama serve

# Test Ollama directly
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### LangGraph Dev Issues

#### Port Already in Use

**Error**: `Address already in use: 8123`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Option 1: Use different port
langgraph dev --port 8124

# Option 2: Find and kill process using port 8123
# macOS/Linux:
lsof -ti:8123 | xargs kill -9

# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :8123
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

#### Graph Not Found

**Error**: `Graph 'support_agent' not found`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Verify langgraph.json is correct
cat langgraph.json

# Make sure file paths are correct
# Should be: "./src/support_agent/agent.py:graph"

# Try absolute import
python -c "from src.support_agent.agent import graph; print(graph)"
```

#### Changes Not Reflecting

**Issue**: Code changes not appearing in LangGraph Studio

**Solution**:

```bash
# LangGraph Dev auto-reloads, but if stuck:
# 1. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Clear Python cache
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -r {} +
# 3. Restart
langgraph dev
```

### Runtime Issues

#### Agent Not Using Tools

**Issue**: Bot responds without calling tools

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Ollama model doesn't support tool calling well**
   - Solution: Use llama3.1:latest, mistral:7b, or qwen2.5:7b
   - These models have better tool calling support

2. **System prompt unclear**
   - Solution: Make tool usage more explicit in prompts.py

3. **Tools not properly bound**
   - Check: `llm.bind_tools(tools)` in agent.py

**Debug**:

```python
# Test tool calling directly
from src.support_agent.agent import llm
result = llm.invoke("Use get_order_status for order #123456")
print(result.tool_calls)  # Should not be empty
```

#### Slow Responses

**Issue**: Bot takes too long to respond

**Solutions**:

```bash
# 1. Use faster model
# Edit src/support_agent/agent.py
llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3.1:latest")  # Fastest

# 2. Check Ollama performance
ollama run llama3.1:latest "Hello"  # Should be fast

# 3. Reduce context
# Limit conversation history if too long

# 4. Check system resources
htop  # macOS/Linux
# Task Manager (Windows)
# Ollama needs RAM for models
```

#### Memory/State Issues

**Issue**: Bot doesn't remember previous messages

**Solution**:

```python
# Check if checkpointer is configured
# In agent.py, verify:
memory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("...")
graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# Check if thread_id is consistent
# In CLI/API, make sure thread_id stays the same

# Verify checkpoint file
ls -lh storage/checkpoints.db
```

#### Tool Execution Errors

**Issue**: Tools failing silently

**Debug**:

```bash
# Run with more logging
export LANGCHAIN_VERBOSE=true
python scripts/cli.py

# Or add print statements in tools.py
@tool
def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
    print(f"DEBUG: Tool called with {param}")
    # ... rest of tool
```

### API Issues

#### API Returns 404

**Error**: `404 Not Found`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check base URL
curl http://localhost:8123/health

# Verify thread exists before sending message
# Create thread first:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8123/threads

# Check LangGraph Dev is running
ps aux | grep langgraph
```

#### API Returns 500

**Error**: `500 Internal Server Error`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check LangGraph Dev logs
# They print to terminal where you ran 'langgraph dev'

# Common causes:
# 1. Ollama not running
# 2. Model not loaded
# 3. Tool error

# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8123/threads/test/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "test"}]}}'
```

#### Streaming Not Working

**Issue**: Can't stream responses

**Solution**:

```python
# Make sure to set stream_mode
payload = {
    "input": {"messages": [...]},
    "stream_mode": "values"  # or "updates"
}

# Use requests with stream=True
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, stream=True)
for line in response.iter_lines():
    # Process line
```

## Performance Optimization

### Reduce Memory Usage

```python
# Use smaller model
llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3.1:latest")

# Limit conversation history
def agent_node(state: SupportState) -> dict:
    # Keep only last 10 messages
    messages = state["messages"][-10:]
    # ... rest of function
```

### Speed Up Tool Execution

```python
# Use async tools
@tool
async def fast_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Async tool."""
    result = await async_operation(param)
    return result

# Cache results
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def cached_lookup(key: str) -> str:
    # Expensive operation
    return result
```

## 🔍 Vector Store Implementation

The knowledge base uses semantic vector search for intelligent document retrieval.

### How It Works

1. **Document Creation**: JSON knowledge base is converted into LangChain `Document` objects with:
   - `page_content`: The actual text content
   - `metadata`: Category tags for filtering (return, shipping, payment, product, general)

2. **Embedding Generation**: Each document is converted to a vector embedding using the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model

3. **Vector Search**: User queries are:
   - Converted to embeddings
   - Compared to all document embeddings using cosine similarity
   - Top-k most similar documents are returned
   - Optional category filtering narrows results

### Benefits

- **Semantic Understanding**: Finds relevant results even when exact keywords don't match
- **Better User Experience**: More intelligent responses to customer queries
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new documents without restructuring code
- **Performance**: In-memory storage provides fast lookups
- **Scalability**: Can easily swap to persistent vector stores (ChromaDB, Pinecone, etc.) for production

### Usage

```python
# General search (all categories)
results = vector_store.search("Can I get a refund?", k=3)

# Category-specific search
results = vector_store.search("shipping options", k=2, filter_category="shipping")
```

### Testing Vector Store

```bash
python scripts/init_vector_store.py
```

## Development

### Hot Reload

LangGraph Dev automatically reloads when you change code. Just save your files and test immediately.

### Graph Visualization

Visualize the LangGraph workflow structure:

**LangGraph Workflow Diagram:**
![LangGraph Customer Support Agent Workflow](images/langgraph-graph-mermaid.png)

The diagram above shows the complete workflow of the customer support agent:

- **Start** → **Agent**: Initial conversation begins
- **Agent** → **End**: Agent can conclude the conversation
- **Agent** → **Tools**: Agent can call support tools when needed
- **Tools** → **Agent**: Tools return results back to agent for further processing

This creates a flexible ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop where the agent can:

1. Analyze customer messages
2. Decide whether to use tools
3. Process tool results
4. Provide final responses or continue the conversation

**Option A: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)**

```bash
# Open the visualization notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/graph_visualization.ipynb
```

**Option B: Python Script**

```bash
# Run the visualization script
python scripts/visualize_graph.py

# Or test the exact code you provided
python scripts/test_graph_viz.py
```

**Option C: Direct Code**

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display
from src.support_agent.agent import graph

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass
```

**Required Dependencies for Visualization:**

```bash
pip install ipython pillow
pip install 'langgraph[visualization]'
```

### Debugging

Use LangGraph Studio to:

- Set breakpoints on nodes
- Step through execution
- Inspect state at any point
- Time-travel debug (rewind and replay)

### Code Style

We use:

- **Black** for formatting: `black src/`
- **Ruff** for linting: `ruff check src/`
- **Type hints** where possible

## Deployment

### Local Production

```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install gunicorn

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker src.support_agent.agent:app
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t support-bot .

# Run container
docker run -p 8123:8123 support-bot
```

### LangGraph Cloud

```bash
# Deploy to LangGraph Cloud
langgraph deploy
```

## Common Patterns

### Adding Sentiment Analysis

```python
@tool
def analyze_sentiment(message: str) -> str:
    """Detect customer emotion."""
    # Use a sentiment model
    from transformers import pipeline
    sentiment = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
    result = sentiment(message)[0]
    
    if result['label'] == 'NEGATIVE' and result['score'] > 0.8:
        return "customer_frustrated"
    return "neutral"
```

### Multi-step Workflows

```python
# For complex workflows, add conditional logic in agent.py
def should_follow_up(state: SupportState) -> str:
    last_msg = state["messages"][-1]
    if "thank" in last_msg.content.lower():
        return "end"
    return "continue"
```
