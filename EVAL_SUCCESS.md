## What Gets Tested

The evaluation includes 10 diverse test cases:

| # | Category | Question |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | return_policy | What's your return policy? |
| 2 | shipping | Do you offer international shipping? |
| 3 | payment | What payment methods do you accept? |
| 4 | order_status | Can you check the status of order #123456? |
| 5 | order_status | Where is my order 789012? |
| 6 | return_request | I want to return order #123456 because it's defective |
| 7 | inventory | Is the wireless mouse in stock? |
| 8 | inventory | Do you have any laptops available? |
| 9 | complex | Hi! I ordered a keyboard last week... |
| 10 | escalation | This is ridiculous! I've been waiting for weeks... |

## Evaluators

Three automated evaluators check each response:

### 1. Tool Usage Evaluator
- **Checks**: Did the agent call the expected tool?
- **Example**: For order status questions, expects `get_order_status` to be called

### 2. Keyword Presence Evaluator
- **Checks**: Does the response contain expected keywords?
- **Example**: For return policy, expects keywords like "30 days", "return", "refund"

### 3. Response Quality Evaluator
- **Checks**: Is the response well-formed?
- **Criteria**:
  - Not too short (>10 words)
  - Not too long (<500 words)
  - Ends with proper punctuation

## How to Use

### Run Evaluation
```bash
# Quick method

## Verified Features

✅ Dataset creation (10 test cases)
✅ Agent execution against each test
✅ Tool calling verification
✅ Keyword presence checking
✅ Response quality evaluation
✅ Upload to LangSmith
✅ Online dashboard viewing
✅ Detailed trace capture
✅ Vector store integration
✅ Escalation detection

## Example Traces Captured

During the evaluation run, the system successfully:

1. **Vector Store Queries**: Loaded 14 documents for knowledge base searches
2. **Order Status Lookups**: Checked multiple order numbers
3. **Product Availability**: Verified stock levels
4. **Escalations**: Detected and logged frustrated customer scenario
5. **Return Processing**: Handled defective item return request

## Next Steps

### 1. View Your Results
Go to the LangSmith URL shown in the output to see:
- Overall performance metrics
- Individual test results
- Full conversation traces
- Tool usage patterns

### 2. Iterate and Improve
Based on results:
- Identify failing tests
- Improve prompts or tools
- Re-run evaluation
- Compare improvements

### 3. Add More Tests
Extend [eval_langsmith.py](src/support_agent/tests/eval_langsmith.py):
```python
test_cases.append({
    "inputs": {"question": "Your new test case"},
    "outputs": {
        "should_mention": ["keywords"],
        "should_use_tool": "tool_name"
    }
})
```

### 4. Track Over Time
Run regularly to:
- Catch regressions
- Measure improvements
- A/B test changes
- Ensure quality

## Integration Options

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/eval.yml
- name: Run Evaluations
  run: |
    export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=${{ secrets.LANGCHAIN_API_KEY }}
    python -m src.support_agent.tests.eval_langsmith
```

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
# Run evals before committing major changes
python -m src.support_agent.tests.eval_langsmith
```

### Scheduled Runs
```bash
# Cron job to run daily
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/project && ./run_eval.sh
```

## Performance

- **Execution Time**: ~31 seconds for 10 examples
- **Concurrency**: 2 examples in parallel (configurable)
- **Scalability**: Can handle 100+ test cases
- **Cost**: Uses your local Ollama LLM (no API costs)

## Support Resources
