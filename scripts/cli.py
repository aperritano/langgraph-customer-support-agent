"""Interactive CLI for customer support bot.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the customer support agent.
You can chat with the agent directly from your terminal, similar to a chat application.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:
Allows you to test and demo the agent without needing a web interface or API.
Great for development, debugging, and demonstrating the agent's capabilities.

Run: python scripts/cli.py

    WHAT IT DOES:
    Displays instructions to help users understand how to use the CLI.
    
    WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:
    Without clear instructions, users wouldn't know what commands are available

    Run interactive CLI.
    
    WHAT IT DOES:
    Main interactive loop that:
    1. Gets customer input from terminal
    2. Sends it to the agent graph
    3. Streams the agent's response back
    4. Shows tool calls as they happen
    5. Handles special commands (quit, new session, help)
    
    WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:
    This is the user-facing interface. It orchestrates the conversation flow,
    maintains session state (using thread_id), and provides real-time feedback
    as the agent processes requests and uses tools.
    
    HOW IT WORKS:
    - Uses asyncio for async operations (required by LangGraph's streaming)
    - Maintains a session ID (thread_id) to preserve conversation context
    - Streams responses so users see updates in real-time
    - Shows tool usage so users understand what the agent is doing
