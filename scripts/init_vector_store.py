"""Script to initialize and test the knowledge base vector store.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
A utility script that loads the knowledge base into the vector store and tests
it with sample queries. Useful for debugging search issues or verifying the
knowledge base loaded correctly.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:
When search isn't working, it's helpful to have a standalone script to test
the vector store directly, without needing to run the full agent. Also useful
for verifying the knowledge base JSON file is formatted correctly.

Run: python scripts/init_vector_store.py

    WHAT IT DOES:
    1. Creates a vector store instance

    4. Displays results for manual inspection

    Provides a quick way to verify the vector store is set up correctly and
    that searches are returning reasonable results.
